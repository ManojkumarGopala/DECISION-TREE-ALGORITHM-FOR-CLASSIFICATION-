# DECISION-TREE-ALGORITHM-FOR-CLASSIFICATION-
Machine Learning Algorithms
Data Mining is widening its scope by using new algorithms applicability in several domains which
assist us in gaining more knowledge and further in decision making. Decision Tree is one such important
technique which builds a tree structure by incrementally breaking down the datasets in smaller subsets.
Decision Trees can be implemented by using popular algorithms such as ID3, C4.5 and CART. The present
study considers ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree. Entropy and Information Gain are used by ID3 to
construct a decision tree
